    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to the Planning de Garde application</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Ok, first of all, you will notice this app is not really beautiful and not totally finished. It is not yet possible to save
        shifts into db for a new worker, as I was having trouble with the library I used for displaying timelines. As I said to Etienne,
        my front-end development skills are a little bit outdated.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>
        Anyway, few words about this app :
    </p>
    <p>
        It is made with spring boot, as it allowed me to bootstrap a web app very quickly.
        If I had to do it again, I think I'd try a MEAN stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data is persisted into a h2 in-memory database, initialized with few samples on startup.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the front-end side, I used bootstrap for a nice rendering.
        The library I used to display shifts as timelines is <em>vis.js</em>.
